TIC TAC TOE PROJECT

IT IS 2 USER BASED GAME.
IT WILL GIVE YOU THE POSITION WHERE YOU CAN ENTER YOUR "O" or "X".
IN THE HOME IT WILL ASK THE PLAYER 1 TO ENTER THE POSITION THEN IT WILL ASK FROM PLAYER 2 IT WILL GO ON TILL ANY PLAYER WIN THE GAME.
IF AFTER FILLING ALL THE POSITIONS STILL THEIR IS NO WINNER THEN IT WILL SHOW THE DRAW MATCH ICON.

IF YOU WIN OR THE MATCH IS DRAW IT WILL ASK YOU IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MORE OR NOT.

IF YOU WANT TO PLAY PRESS 1 ELSE PRESS 2

YOU CAN EXIT THE GAME ANY TIME IN THE PROGRAM.
